# Bancho Box

A companion app for **Dave the Diver**, built to help players have fun managing the restaurant.

**üåê Visit the application:** [banchobox.com](https://banchobox.com)

## Features

- **Complete dish database** with unlock conditions, pricing, and party bonuses
- **Comprehensive ingredient catalog** with sources and gathering information
- **Party event listings** with associated dishes and bonus multipliers

## Development

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

### Data Processing

The application processes CSV data files into optimized JSON bundles. Before running the development server, you need to build the data:

```sh
npm run build:data
```

This command imports and pre-computes data from CSV files in the `data/` directory, creating optimized JSON files in `src/lib/data/`.

### Running the Development Server

Start the development server (this automatically runs `build:data` first):

```sh
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

### Building for Production

To create a production version of the app:

```sh
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.
